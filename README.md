Welcome to Week 46 of the Weekly MachineHack Hackathon Series!

This week’s challenge tasks participants with building machine learning models for **Taxi Trip Distance Prediction** using real-world taxi data.

---

## Challenge Overview

- **Domain:** Machine Learning
- **Task:** Predict taxi trip distance (`trip_distance_miles`) from provided features.
- **Level:** Intermediate (requires basic knowledge of ML & DL)
- **Problem Statement:** Build advanced models to solve a real-world regression problem using curated Taxi datasets.

---

## Challenge Details

In this hackathon, you'll:
- **Develop ML models** to predict taxi trip distance (in miles) using features in the dataset.
- Compete for top leaderboard positions and certificates.

---

## Data Description

The dataset provides:

- `train.csv`: Taxi data for model training.
- `test.csv`: Data for final predictions.
- `submission.csv`: The format for your submissions.

---

## Participation and Benefits

- **Community Engagement:** Join discussions, ask questions, and collaborate via our [Telegram Group](#).
- **Certificates:** All participants receive a certificate. Winners appear on the leaderboard.
- **Support:** Get help via our support email and community channels.

## Submission and Evaluation

- **Submission Format:** Submit predictions as per `submission.csv` structure.
- **Evaluation Metric:** 
    - `R2_Score` for leaderboard ranking.
    - `root_mean_squared_error` (stated as primary metric).
- **Leaderboard:** Monitor your performance and aim for the top.
- **Submission Limit:** Max 9 submissions/day.
- **Notebook Format:** Only `.ipynb` files accepted.

## Notebook Starter Kit

A starter notebook will be provided to all subscribers, guiding you through:

- Data pre-processing
- Basic model-building
- Prediction formatting

You’re encouraged to customize and extend it for your final solution!

## How to Crack This Challenge

**Data Pre-processing**
- Handle missing values (impute/remove as needed)
- Remove unnecessary columns

**Model Development**
- Use: Ridge/Lasso Regression, RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, etc.

**Training & Optimization**
- Apply grid search, Bayesian Optimization, RandomizedSearchCV for tuning
- Use cross-validation for robust performance

**Validation & Testing**
- Ensure your model generalizes to unseen data
- Generate predictions for the test set as per required submission format

---

## Problem Recap

- **Target/Label:** `trip_distance_miles`
- **Metric:** `root_mean_squared_error` (for main performance evaluation)
- **Level:** Intermediate
- **Daily Submission Limit:** 9
